Is it insightful?
78/100
This text presents a coherent philosophical argument about the nature of literal meaning that demonstrates solid analytical thinking but falls short of exceptional insight. The author develops a clear thesis: that literal and understood meaning must converge for simple expressions because 'systematic, widespread error is impossible where semantically simple expressions are concerned,' while they can diverge for complex expressions due to compositional difficulties rather than misunderstanding of simple parts. The argument's strength lies in its logical structure and the way it builds from an initial intuition to a systematic account. The author effectively uses the principle that meaning is partly determined by usage to argue that simple expressions cannot be systematically misunderstood by competent speakers. The distinction between simple and complex expressions provides a useful framework for understanding different types of semantic phenomena. However, the text has several limitations that prevent it from reaching higher scores. The writing is often unnecessarily convoluted and repetitive - the same points are restated multiple times without adding clarity or depth. The formal notation (‹...Socrates...›, ‹...wise...›) feels forced and doesn't enhance understanding. More significantly, the argument relies heavily on intuitions without engaging with potential counterexamples or alternative theories. The author doesn't address obvious challenges like semantic change over time, technical terminology, or cross-cultural variation in concepts. The analysis would benefit from more rigorous consideration of what constitutes 'systematic error' and whether the intuitions about simple expressions are as clear-cut as claimed. While competent and potentially publishable in a philosophy journal, this represents solid but not exceptional academic work - the kind produced by graduate students or junior faculty rather than leading figures in the field.

Key Quotes:
"It makes no sense to suppose that people could be systematically wrong as to what 'red' meant. If people thought that 'red' meant what is in fact meant by 'blue,' then 'red' would have that meaning."
"Systematic, widespread error is impossible where semantically simple expressions are concerned. This gives us a way of understanding what literal meaning is."
"Even though there can be widespread, systematic misinterpretations of sentences, those misinterpretations do not arise as a result of people failing to know what the simple parts of sentences mean. They arise as a result of people not knowing how to put those meanings together."
"What a simple expression literally means is determined by what it is that a sentence means by virtue of containing it."
"A divergence between (i) A sentence's literal meaning and (ii) That sentence's understood meaning is the same thing as a divergence between (a) That sentence's literal meaning and (b) What it is that, given their (correct) beliefs as to what its simple parts literally mean, people are disposed to take that sentence's literal meaning to be."
Does it develop points? (Or, if it is a short excerpt, is there evidence that it would develop points if extended)?
78/100
This text demonstrates solid philosophical development of its central thesis about literal meaning, though with some structural and clarity limitations. The author develops a coherent argument through several stages: (1) establishing that simple expressions cannot be systematically misunderstood, (2) explaining how misinterpretation arises from compositional rather than lexical failures, (3) defining literal meaning in terms of what sentences mean by virtue of containing expressions, and (4) formalizing the distinction between literal and understood meaning for complex expressions. The development is genuinely philosophical - moving from intuitive observations to formal distinctions. The Socrates example effectively illustrates the theoretical points, and the final formal schema with conditions (i)/(ii) and (a)/(b) represents meaningful theoretical progress. However, the development has notable weaknesses: the argument structure could be clearer, some transitions are abrupt, key claims need more support (like why systematic error is 'impossible' for simple expressions), and the writing is dense without sufficient scaffolding for readers. The text reads like a competent graduate-level philosophical work - it develops substantive points and makes theoretical progress, but lacks the exceptional clarity, rigor, and compelling argumentation that would elevate it to top-tier academic writing. About 22% of people could likely produce more clearly structured and better supported philosophical argumentation.

Key Quotes:
"Where complex expressions are concerned, there is no limit to how much literal and understood meaning may diverge from each other. But where simple expressions are concerned, literal and understood meaning must coalesce."
"Even though there can be widespread, systematic misinterpretations of sentences, those misinterpretations do not arise as a result of people failing to know what the simple parts of sentences mean. They arise as a result of people not knowing how to put those meanings together."
"What a simple expression literally means is determined by what it is that a sentence means by virtue of containing it."
"A divergence between (i) A sentence's literal meaning and (ii) That sentence's understood meaning is the same thing as a divergence between (a) That sentence's literal meaning and (b) What it is that, given their (correct) beliefs as to what its simple parts literally mean, people are disposed to take that sentence's literal meaning to be."
Is the organization merely sequential (just one point after another, little or no logical scaffolding)? Or are the ideas arranged, not just sequentially but hierarchically?
78/100
The text demonstrates a clear hierarchical organization rather than mere sequential listing. The author establishes a foundational distinction between simple and complex expressions early on, then systematically builds upon this framework to develop a comprehensive theory of literal meaning. The organization follows a logical progression: (1) establishing the core principle that simple expressions cannot be systematically misunderstood, (2) explaining how this principle applies to complex expressions, (3) providing concrete illustrations, and (4) synthesizing these insights into formal definitions. The author uses numbered points (i) and (ii), lettered subsections (a) and (b), and explicit logical connectors to create clear hierarchical relationships between ideas. However, the execution has some weaknesses - certain transitions could be smoother, and some explanatory passages become somewhat repetitive or circuitous. The writing is competent graduate-level philosophical work that shows genuine theoretical development, but falls short of the exceptional clarity and elegance that would characterize top-tier academic writing.

"The literal meaning of a complex expression is a function of two things: (i) the meanings of its simple parts, and (ii) the order in which those parts are arranged."
