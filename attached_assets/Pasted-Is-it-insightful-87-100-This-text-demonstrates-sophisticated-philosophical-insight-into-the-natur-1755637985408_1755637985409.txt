Is it insightful?
87/100
This text demonstrates sophisticated philosophical insight into the nature of literal meaning through a genuinely novel theoretical framework. The core insight - that 'systematic, widespread error is impossible where semantically simple expressions are concerned' - is both counterintuitive and compelling. The author provides a clear mechanism: if everyone thought 'red' meant blue, then 'red' would mean blue by virtue of that collective understanding. This dissolves a genuine philosophical puzzle about how meaning is grounded. The distinction between simple and complex expressions is well-developed and explanatorily powerful. The author shows that misunderstandings arise not from getting basic word meanings wrong, but from compositional failures - problems in 'putting those meanings together.' This provides a principled account of where semantic confusion enters the system. The formal structure (mapping literal meaning to functions of simple parts plus arrangement) demonstrates technical sophistication. The Socrates examples effectively illustrate the theory in action. However, the writing becomes somewhat repetitive and convoluted in places, particularly in the final paragraphs where the same points are restated with increasing abstraction. The prose could be tighter and more direct. This work engages seriously with fundamental questions in philosophy of language and offers a substantive theoretical contribution. While not groundbreaking enough for the highest tier, it represents genuinely above-average philosophical thinking that most people would not arrive at independently.

Key Quotes:
"Systematic, widespread error is impossible where semantically simple expressions are concerned"
"If people thought that 'red' meant what is in fact meant by 'blue,' then 'red' would have that meaning"
"those misinterpretations do not arise as a result of people failing to know what the simple parts of sentences mean. They arise as a result of people not knowing how to put those meanings together"
"What a simple expression literally means is determined by what it is that a sentence means by virtue of containing it"
Does it develop points? (Or, if it is a short excerpt, is there evidence that it would develop points if extended)?
88/100
This text demonstrates exceptional developmental rigor in philosophical analysis. The author systematically builds a theory of literal meaning through careful logical progression, moving from the foundational insight about simple vs. complex expressions to increasingly sophisticated distinctions. The development follows a clear architecture: (1) establish the core principle that simple expressions cannot be systematically misunderstood, (2) explain how this differs for complex expressions, (3) provide concrete illustration with 'Socrates,' (4) formalize the distinction with precise logical notation, and (5) synthesize into a comprehensive theory. Each point builds necessarily on the previous, with the author anticipating objections (like sarcastic usage) and refining definitions accordingly. The use of formal notation (‹...Socrates...›, variables like CE and e1...en) shows sophisticated analytical development. However, the prose occasionally becomes dense and could benefit from clearer transitions between major developmental stages. The score reflects writing that 12% of a general population could match - this requires sustained abstract reasoning and systematic theory-building that most people cannot execute at this level of precision.

Key Quotes:
"Where complex expressions are concerned, there is no limit to how much literal and understood meaning may diverge from each other. But where simple expressions are concerned, literal and understood meaning must coalesce."
"Even though there can be widespread, systematic misinterpretations of sentences, those misinterpretations do not arise as a result of people failing to know what the simple parts of sentences mean. They arise as a result of people not knowing how to put those meanings together."
"Here's an illustration. 'Socrates' is a simple expression. So what people think it means must ultimately coincide with what it actually means."
"A divergence between (i) A sentence's literal meaning and (ii) That sentence's understood meaning is the same thing as a divergence between (a) That sentence's literal meaning and (b) What it is that, given their (correct) beliefs as to what its simple parts literally mean, people are disposed to take that sentence's literal meaning to be."
"The literal meaning of a complex expression is a function of two things: (i) the meanings of its simple parts, and (ii) the order in which those parts are arranged."
Is the organization merely sequential (just one point after another, little or no logical scaffolding)? Or are the ideas arranged, not just sequentially but hierarchically?

This text demonstrates sophisticated hierarchical organization rather than mere sequential listing. The author constructs a logical scaffold that builds systematically from foundational distinctions to increasingly complex theoretical machinery. The structure follows this hierarchy: (1) Establishes the fundamental distinction between literal and understood meaning, (2) Introduces the key constraint that simple expressions cannot exhibit systematic semantic error, (3) Uses this constraint to explain how misunderstanding occurs (compositional failure, not lexical failure), (4) Leverages these insights to define literal meaning formally, (5) Provides concrete illustration with 'Socrates', (6) Generalizes the account to all complex expressions via formal variables (CE, e1...en), and (7) Concludes with a complete theoretical statement. Each stage depends logically on the previous ones - the impossibility of systematic error about simple expressions is crucial for the compositional account of misunderstanding, which in turn grounds the formal definition of literal meaning. The author explicitly signals this logical dependency with phrases like 'This gives us a way of understanding what literal meaning is' and 'Given the points just made, we can do this.' The movement from specific examples ('Socrates was more wise than Plato') to formal generalization (CE composed of e1...en) shows genuine theoretical abstraction rather than mere enumeration. However, the execution has some friction - certain transitions could be smoother and some formulations are unnecessarily convoluted, preventing this from reaching the highest tier.

Key Quotes:
"This gives us a way of understanding what literal meaning is."
"Given the points just made, we can do this."
"Bearing these points in mind, let CE be any complex expression, and let e1...en be the simple expressions composing it."
"Since what people take simple expressions to mean is what they mean, this is the same as saying the following."
"The literal meaning of a complex expression is a function of two things: (i) the meanings of its simple parts, and (ii) the order in which those parts are arranged."
