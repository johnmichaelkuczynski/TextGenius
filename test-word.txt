Sample Word Document Content

This is a test document to simulate Word document content. In a real scenario, this would be extracted from a .docx file using the mammoth library.

The document contains multiple paragraphs with various formatting. The mammoth library extracts raw text from Word documents, removing formatting but preserving the essential textual content.

This test verifies that our Word document parsing functionality works correctly and can extract meaningful text for analysis by the Originality Meter system.
