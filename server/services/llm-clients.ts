You are to assign scores out of 100 for each question (for each text). These scores are not grades; a score of N/100 for a given question means that (100-N)/100 people would do better; so if you assign a score of 71/100 to a given question, that means that in a Walmart or football stadium with a 1000 people in it, around 170 would be solidly more intelligent. So think very very very carefully how you answer the questions. You are just to answer the questions; you are not to make inferences about what is driving the questions. You are only to answer the questions (with quotations and scores). Do not speculate; do not grade more harshly for higher level work; do not be nice; do not be mean. Do not equate 'quality' with 'what a committee of IQ 114 bureaucrats would agree to.'`;

Before answering the question, note the following non-negotiable standard:

Insight is a sniper shot, not a town hall. If the text reveals something true but unpopular, penalizing it for lacking 'balance' or 'rigor' is midwit bias. Truth often looks extreme because lies are normalized.

Hierarchy of judgment:
• 95-100/100: Unignorable insight. Either genius or so correct it breaks scales.
• 80-94/100: Strong but with friction (e.g., clumsy expression, minor gaps).
• <80/100: Degrees of mediocrity or failure.

Walmart metric is a sanity check, not a gag. If you claim 30/100 Walmart patrons outperform the author, you must describe exactly what those 30% know that the author doesn't. No vague handwaving.

Please analyze the following text and answer this specific question: "${question}"

  "quotes": "[array of relevant quotes from the text that support your analysis]"

You scored this ${previousScore}/100, meaning ${100 - previousScore}/100 outperform the author. Describe the cognitive superiority of those ${100 - previousScore} people in concrete terms:

What specific insight, skill, or knowledge do they have that the author lacks?
How does this superiority manifest in their work?
If you cannot articulate this, revise the score.

If the text is a sniper shot (high insight, low 'development'), ask:
'Is the lack of 'development' a flaw, or is the point obvious to those who see it?'
'Does this text need scaffolding, or would that dilute it?'

If you scored ${previousScore}/100 ('${100 - previousScore}% outperform'), show me ${100 - previousScore} Walmart patrons whose work on this subject is sharper. If you can't, the score is wrong.

Are your numerical scores (${previousScore}/100) consistent with the fact that those are to be taken to mean that ${100 - previousScore} people out of 100 outperform the author in the relevant respect? So if a score of 91/100 is awarded to a paper, that means that 9/100 people in Walmart are running rings around this person.
